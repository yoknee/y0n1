    <div id="Tab2" class="tabcontent">
      <p>My name is Jonathan (aka Yoni). I grew up in LA, and I've always had a passion for design. My very first job was in high school at Circuit City, where they called me "The Game Master." I held the record for five years selling the most consoles in the region. I went on to get a degree from the only university that I could pay for (shout out to CSUCI!) with a Circuit City paycheck while simultaneously getting sucked into the startup world.</p>
      <p>After working at various startups on the West Coast, I embarked on a road trip across the country in search of lobster - ended up in NYC and never left. I met a girl, married her, had a child, and got a job at Mana Contemporary. I had another child and then got a job at CBS. Along the way, I crossed paths with an Obama impersonator named Dean, bought a car off Craigslist, and went on more road trips with the family. I taught one of my kids how to swim and gifted the other one some rainbow stickers. Inspired by Bitcoin, I wrote a children's book about it. Adding to our family, we welcomed another child and then secured a job at PwC.</p>
      <p>While watching Hulu's The Bear, I was told that I resembled the Chef in the show - and then was told the same many more times walking around the city. On a date with my wife, she kindly advised me to get a haircut and aim for an even better job. I instead got a fishing permit for a secluded NYC beach, went fishing, and caught a plastic bag. Nevertheless, I did discover a fantastic new bar in the neighborhood and perfected the art of making a Bloody Mary. I also obtained a sailing permit, which was a fantastic excuse to not hang with the fam for a minute, and became an expert at redesigning our apartment layout, having done it 5,000 times. I hosted one (yes, one) poker game at my house, which became a memorable event that my friends and I often talk about without inclination to host another one. I then took the initiative to start a Dads group in my South Brooklyn neighborhood. For spring break, I took my now family of five back to LA, and fortunately, no one threw up on the plane - success! However, I did encounter a lice problem at one point.</p>
      <p>My wife and I celebrated our 10-year anniversary - w00t w00t! I began dressing like Steve Jobs and organized a successful stoop sale, raking in $345. Unfortunately, I accidentally sold my favorite T-shirt. At my wife's suggestion, I realized the need for a better website to improve my job prospects - hence, this. Over time, my wife and I began dressing alike. I will now kindly request you to like my site and consider hiring me to make her happy. Happy wife, happy life &#129335; I told her I'm working, but in reality, I'm watching sports and browsing Craigslist for old record players and mid-century furniture.</p>
